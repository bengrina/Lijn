# Lijn
"Bande Dessinée" reader app for iPad, developed using Swift and SwiftUI

## Current state

I'm currently working on CBZ support, and on refactoring my code.

## About

Simply put, Lijn is a fancy database for comics in the PDF or CBR/CBZ format. I read lots of Bandes Dessinées on my iPad, and I wanted an app that presents my collection in a beautiful and fast way.

It's my first project, and I will write about it on my [blog](https://bengrina.github.io).

### Goals

The app has to be fast, easy to use, and well designed.

### Dependencies

- [Realm](https://realm.io/): Fast and reactive database
- [WaterfallGrid](https://github.com/paololeonardi/WaterfallGrid): Grid layout view for the library

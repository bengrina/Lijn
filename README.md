# Lijn
"Bande Dessinée" reader app for iPad, programmed in swift.

## About

Simply put, Lijn is a fancy database for comics in the PDF or CBR/CBZ format. I read lots of Bandes Dessinées on my iPad, and I wanted an app that presents my collection in a beautiful and fast way.

It's my first project, and I will blog about it on my [blog](aymanebengrina.github.io).

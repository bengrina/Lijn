# Lijn
"Bande Dessinée" reader app for iPad, developed using Swift and SwiftUI

## State

Far from release

## About

Simply put, Lijn is a fancy database for comics in the PDF or CBR/CBZ format. I read lots of Bandes Dessinées on my iPad, and I wanted an app that presents my collection in a beautiful and fast way.

It's my first project, and I will write about it on my [blog](https://bengrina.github.io).

### Objectives

I plan to release a fast and easy to use app. To do that, i'm using Realm as a database, and plan to use MuPdf as the viewer.
